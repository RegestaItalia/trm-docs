# TRM Public Registry

TRM Public Registry is the official TRM registry implementation.

By default, each TRM client is setup to work with the public registry.

A person may be able to download a package without the need of an account.

Restrictions on the account are based on its plan. Differences between plans can be seen [here](https://trmregistry.com/#/plans).

The public registry exposes [REST APIs](api/README.md) that may be used to perform actions programmatically.
