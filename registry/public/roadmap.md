> **Current Stage**: Stage 3 – ✅ **Production**

# Roadmap

Nobody likes projects without a clear direction — here's a detailed roadmap for the **TRM Public Registry**.

Unlike rigid timelines, TRM uses **time-based milestones** with estimated durations instead of fixed dates. This approach ensures flexibility without compromising transparency.

To stay informed about updates, including milestone changes, sign up at [TRM Public Registry](https://trmregistry.com) and enable notifications in your profile settings.
