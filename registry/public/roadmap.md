- **General notes**:
    
    This is the **Alpha** stage.
    
    TRM as a whole is announced. In this phase, the registry should **NOT** be used in **production** environment.
    
    The expected use is for testing the capabilities of TRM and allowing users to understand how it works and whether they should invest time in the project.
    
    The expected packages published in this phase are sample codes.
    
    Bugs/fixes are expected in the first period of time. This means **frequent maintenance**.
    
    In this period, community engagement as well as user activity on the project and the registry will be **monitored**.
    
    This data will be used to evaluate the next stage.
    
    **Free accounts** are available for everyone. Without a paid account, users are only allowed to publish **public packages** and **organizations won't be accessible**.
    
    All data (including transports) is stored on US East (N. Virginia) servers without the possibility of changing region.
    
    Upon signup, users agree to as-is privacy and security of all their stored data.

    The main goal is to enable the paid subscription feature of the registry.
