# Roadmap

Nobody likes projects without a clear roadmap.

Here is an explanation in detail of what to expect from TRM Public Registry.

You'll notice that these roadmap milestones don't have specific dates, but rather an estimated amount of time.

To stay up to date with the developments and get notified whenever a milestone date is updated, sign up to [TRM Public Registry](https://trmregistry.com), and make sure to keep the notifications turned on in your profile management page.

For any question, you can create a Github issue [here](https://github.com/RegestaItalia/trm-docs) or write an email to [support@trmregistry.com](mailto:support@trmregistry.com).
